## ðŸ’» MERN Stack Developer

I specialize in building full-stack web applications using the MERN stack:

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for fast, flexible, and scalable data storage.
- **Express**: Minimal and powerful web application framework for building backend APIs.
- **React**: Frontend library for building interactive user interfaces with reusable components.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime that allows me to build scalable server-side applications.
